 desc_nationalism_institution:0 "Nationalism is a shared group feeling in the significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic region seeking independence for its culture or ethnicity that holds that group together. This can be expressed as a belief or political ideology that involves an individual identifying with or becoming attached to one's nation. The early emergence of a popular patriotic nationalism took place in the first half of the 19th century, and was actively promoted by the European governments and by the writers and intellectuals of the time. National symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives were assiduously constructed and adopted. The political development of nationalism and the push for popular sovereignty culminated with the national revolutions of Europe, such as the Greek War of Independence of 1821–1829. Since that time, nationalism has become one of the most significant political and social forces in history."

This trend is further encouraged by artists who are constructing national symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives. These new personal behaviours that support a state's decisions and actions could be very beneficial, but on the other hand this could lead to increased separatism among those who do not identify with our culture."
